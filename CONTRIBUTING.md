# Contributing to Leash Secrets

Thank you for wanting to make the internet a little safer. Leash Secrets grows stronger with every contribution.

## How to Contribute

### 1. Add a Secret Pattern (Most Impactful)

Found a secret type that leash-secrets doesn't detect? Adding a pattern is the single most valuable contribution.

**Steps:**

1. Fork the repo
2. Find the right pattern file in `patterns/` (or create a new one)
3. Add your pattern following the schema in `patterns/schema.json`
4. Test it against real-world examples (redacted)
5. Submit a PR

**Pattern template:**

```json
{
  "id": "service-secret-type",
  "name": "Human-Readable Name",
  "severity": "critical",
  "regex": "your_regex_here",
  "description": "What this secret is",
  "risk": "What an attacker can do with it",
  "fix": "How to fix it (env var name, secret manager, etc.)",
  "rotation_url": "https://where-to-rotate.com",
  "false_positive_hints": ["When this pattern is NOT a real secret"]
}
```

**Requirements for patterns:**

- Regex must be tested against at least 3 real examples (redacted in the PR)
- Must include risk assessment and fix guidance
- Must not match common placeholder values (`test`, `example`, `your-key-here`)
- Should include `false_positive_hints` if the pattern has known false positives
- Use the `patterns/schema.json` for validation

### 2. Reduce False Positives

If leash-secrets is flagging something that isn't a secret:

1. Open an issue with the false positive example
2. Suggest an allowlist rule or regex refinement
3. Submit a PR with the fix

### 3. Add Agent Support

Want leash-secrets to work with a new AI agent?

1. Create the adapter file (rule file, plugin config, etc.)
2. Add install instructions to `scripts/install.sh`
3. Add documentation to the README
4. Submit a PR

### 4. Improve Documentation

- Better examples
- Translations
- Guides for specific stacks (Django, Rails, Next.js, etc.)

### 5. Fix Bugs

Check the [issues](https://github.com/FasterApiWeb/leash-secrets/issues) for bugs and feature requests.

## Development Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FasterApiWeb/leash-secrets.git
cd leash-secrets
npm install

# Validate patterns
node scripts/check-patterns.js

# Run tests
npm test

# Package VS Code extension (dry run)
npm run package-extension
```

## Maintainer Release Setup

**Full reference (workflow table, secrets, mental model, ship steps):**  
[docs/contributing/ci-cd.md](docs/contributing/ci-cd.md) · published site: [CI/CD & Releases](https://fasterapiweb.github.io/leash-secrets/contributing/ci-cd/)

Quick path: **Actions → Release Draft (auto-bumps) → Publish draft → npm**. Prefer Release Draft over legacy release-please.

### One-time secrets

| Secret | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `NPM_TOKEN` | Publish to npm (**required** to ship) |
| `RELEASE_TOKEN` or `RELEASE_APP_*` | Recommended for Release Draft push to protected `main` (else `GITHUB_TOKEN` may be blocked) |
| `VSCE_PAT` | VS Code marketplace *(deferred)* |

Details: [ci-cd.md — Secrets](docs/contributing/ci-cd.md#secrets-needed).

### Release checklist (short)

1. **Actions → Release Draft → Run** (`patch` / `minor` / `major`) — bumps version on `main` if needed, creates draft  
2. **Releases → Publish** the draft → **Publish npm** runs (skips if version already on npm)  

If the draft push fails: add `RELEASE_TOKEN` (admin PAT / bypass) and re-run.  
If you only need npm: **Actions → Publish npm → Run workflow**.
## PR Guidelines

- **One pattern per PR** if adding patterns (makes review fast)
- **Include test cases** (redacted real-world examples)
- **Update the README** pattern count if adding new patterns
- **Keep commits atomic** — one logical change per commit
- **Use conventional commits**: `feat: add datadog pattern`, `fix: reduce aws false positives`

## Maintainer Governance

To keep the project secure and maintainable:

- `main` is protected: direct pushes are disabled for contributors
- Pull requests are required for all changes
- Required checks must pass before merge
- CODEOWNER review is required for security-sensitive paths
- Release tags and publish workflows are maintainer-controlled

If you are an external contributor, open a PR and include a clear test plan. Maintainers will guide you through any required adjustments.

## Writing allowlist rules

Allowlist patterns are **line-level** suppressions for educational/placeholder text.
They must never suppress the secret grammar itself.

**Good**
- `/not[_-]?a[_-]?real/i`
- `/REPLACE_ME/i`
- `/example\.com/i`

**Bad**
- `/-----BEGIN [A-Z0-9 ]+ PRIVATE KEY-----/` (matches real RSA/OpenSSH findings)
- Over-broad `\.+` / `...` tokens that appear in legitimate secrets

When adding an FP rule:
1. Add a **positive** fixture that still detects a real secret.
2. Add a **negative** fixture for the educational line you want suppressed.
3. Run the pattern test suite (`npm test` / project test script).

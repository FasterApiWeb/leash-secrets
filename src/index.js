 * SOLID architecture:
 *   S — Each module has one responsibility (load, scan, report)
 *   O — New patterns added via JSON without modifying core code
 *   L — All pattern sources (file, remote, custom) conform to the same schema
 *   I — Consumers import only the functions they need
 *   D — Scanner depends on pattern abstractions, not concrete files
